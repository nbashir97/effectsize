    Computes SDs for all specified variables
    
    Parameters:
        data (dataframe): Pandas DataFrame containing observations (rows) and variables (columns)
        exposure (str): Variable defining exposed and unexposed
        continuous (list): List of string items which are names of the continuous variables for which the SD should be computed
        categorical (list): List of string items which are names of the categorical variables for which the SD should be computed
        skewed (list): List of string items which are names of the continuous variables which have a skewed distribution (ranked SD computed)
        weights (None or str): Variable defining weights for each observation (otherwise assumed to be equally weighted)
        decimals (int): Number of decimal places which should be computed
        intervals (None or float): Whether CIs should be computed and with what coverage e.g. for 95% CI, intervals = 0.95
    
    Returns:
        Returns a Pandas DataFrame containing the computed SDs (plus CIs, if specified)
